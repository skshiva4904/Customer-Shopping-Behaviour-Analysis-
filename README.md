## 🎯 Business Problem
Organizations collect large volumes of customer shopping data, but raw data is often inconsistent and difficult to analyze directly. Without proper cleaning and analysis, businesses struggle to understand customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and sales trends.

This project addresses the problem by cleaning raw data, storing it in a relational database, performing structured analysis, and visualizing insights for decision-making.
